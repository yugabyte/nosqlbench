# Baselines Version 1

In order to avoid changing those tests and possibly impacting
results without warning, the baseline sets are being kept
in separate directories.

## Status

This directory is for baselines version 1. The files in this directory
should not be modified arbitrarily. They need to remain stable so that
comparisons to previous results based on these workloads are still valid.
