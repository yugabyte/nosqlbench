# Baselines Version 2

In order to avoid changing those tests and possibly impacting
results without warning, the baseline sets are being kept
in separate directories.

## Status

This directory is for baselines version 2. These files are the current
in-development set of baselines, and may change in minor ways, or have
additional workloads added, for example. If you are performing baselines
over a period of time and need the workloads to be perfectly stable,
it is best to copy these to your test assets under a distinct name and
call them from there.

To further disambiguate the workloads, each one has a version '2'
appended to the filename.
