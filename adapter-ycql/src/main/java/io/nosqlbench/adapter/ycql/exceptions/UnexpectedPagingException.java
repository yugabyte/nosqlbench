/**
 * <p>This is not a core exception. It was added to the CQL activity type
 * driver for nosqlbench specifically to catch the following unexpected
 * condition:
 * Paging would be needed to read all the results from a read query, but the user
 * is not expecting to intentionally check and iterate the result sets for paging.
 * <p>
 * This should only be thrown if a result set would need paging, but configuration
 * options specific that it should not expect to. Rather than assume paging is completely
 * expected or unexpected, we simply assume that only 1 page is allowed, being the
 * first page, or what is thought of as "not paging".
 * <p>If this error is thrown, and paging is expected, then the user can adjust
 * fetchsize or maxpages in order to open up paging to the degree that is allowable or
 * expected.
